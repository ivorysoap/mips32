# IEEE_LED_Sign
Material for an LED sign for the IEEE uOttawa office.  

When the door is open (meaning someone's in the office), the sign blinks out "IEEE" in morse code in blue.  When the door is closed, the lights stay off.  I made this with [@PirateRoberts98](https://github.com/PirateRoberts98) using some LED strips, an Arduino Nano, a relay, a magnetic reed switch, and copious amounts of solder.
